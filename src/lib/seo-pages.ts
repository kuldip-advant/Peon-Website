Coolify made the category familiar; Peon is built for the next step: project RBAC, audit logs, MCP and in-app AI on standard plans. Among PaaS providers built for teams rather than solo labs, the promise is Heroku-shaped workflows on infrastructure you already own, with features peers rarely ship together.',

The platform installs or uses Docker, stands up a reverse proxy (Traefik by default on Peon, with Caddy as an option), terminates TLS with Let’s Encrypt on ports 80/443, and deploys from Git, Dockerfiles, images or Compose. Your apps and databases share a private Docker network on that machine, or across several machines you connect.',
